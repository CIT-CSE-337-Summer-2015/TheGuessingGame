# TheGuessingGame

The Guessing Game allows the user to think of a number 1 through 1023, and the app will guess the user’s number in 10 guesses or fewer, given the correct guess feedback arguments.

# System-Level Requirements
 
-     The system shall provide a means for the user to start the game.
-     The system shall provide a means for the user to quit the game.
-     The upper bound shall be 1024.
-     The system shall display the guessable range (1 – 1023)
-     The system shall provide a means for User to inform the device that he/she has selected a number between 1 and 1,023.
-     The system shall be able to find the number in 10 guesses or less
-     The system shall have a way to determine what guess it is on.
-     The system shall be able to receive feedback from the user:
  -      The guess is correct.
  -      The guess is too high
  -      The guess is too low.
-     The system shall be able to determine the next number to guess.
- The system shall be able to store the last number that it guessed.
-  The system shall be able to display the number guessed
- The system shall have a way to end the game once either the guessed number is correct or the maximum guess count is reached.
 
Extra Credit:
- A means for the user to set the upper bound
- Use binomial theorem to log base 2 to determine number of guesses, round up to whole number if log is a decimal
